    <h1 class="heading">Hello and welcome to howtogetthroughit, the place where all first-time students who don’t know where to go, go!
    </h1>

<h3>The purpose of this website is to help educate students who don’t have much guidance going into college find out where to start.</h3> 

    <p class="paragraph">The first objective will be to set up your first meeting with an advisor, navigate through your connections, and find your success network. 
    The second will be to find out your school email and how to check it, being sure to stay updated on what’s happening with school at all times. 
    The third will be learning how to check your degree checklist and stay in the know for what classes apply to your degree and what classes don’t. 
    Lastly, the fourth will be how to view and pay for your bill! The goal is for you to leave the site knowing that you are fully prepared for the first day of your college career and can check your email, contact your advisor, and check your degree progress.</p>
