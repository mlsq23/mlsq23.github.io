    <p>Hello, my name is MeKayla, and I am currently a senior pursuing a <em>bachelor’s</em> degree in <strong>general studies</strong> with a focus on <strong>economics, cultural studies, and management & financial leadership</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am scheduled to graduate from the school of arts and sciences in December 2024, after which I plan to continue my education by pursuing a Master of Accountancy. 
        I graduated and got my high school diploma from Ritenour High School in St. Louis, MO, where I also pursued dual enrollment.
        I graduated summa cum laude and had a few college credits under my belt already from St. Louis Community College, which I took with me to start my (official) college career at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p> 
    <p>In addition to my academic and professional aspirations, I have a range of hobbies, including, but not limited to, playing video games, drawing, and spending time with my dog.</p> 
    
    <p>My favorite quote is:</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.” —Will Rogers</blockquote>
